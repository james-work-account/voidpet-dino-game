# Voidpet Dinosaur Game

Inspired by the Google Chrome offline dinosaur game, but with some artistic liberties taken...

## TODO: Enhancements

- Accessibility - most of this is made with empty divs and zero aria-labels. It would be nice if it were properly WCAG-compliant.
- Testing - this has so far been exclusively tested through manually playing with it. I'd like to get some automated tests in here - with Selenium or something else idk yet.
- Mobile (landscape) - I didn't make this with Mobile (landscape) in mind. Need to address this.
