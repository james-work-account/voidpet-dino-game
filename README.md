# Voidpet Dino Game

Inspired by the Google Chrome offline dinosaur game, but with some artistic liberties taken...

## TODO: Enhancements

- Accessibility - most of this is made with empty divs and zero aria-labels. It would be nice if it were properly WCAG-compliant.
- Testing - this has so far been exclusively tested through manually playing with it. I'd like to get some automated tests in here - with Selenium or something else idk yet.

### Credits

- Shout out to [Keep coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7nIutSLvdU) for the tutorial which inspired this idea.
